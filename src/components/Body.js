            <strong>Susan Wong</strong> was born in Hong Kong and emigrated to
            Sydney, Australia with her family at the age of seven. Musically
            inclined from a young age, she learned to play the piano from five
            and later also learned the violin. At school in Sydney she sang alto
            in the choir and appeared in the school dramas (Gilbert & Sullivan &
            the like) and entered a number of piano competitions. She received
            an associate degree, ATCL, in piano at Trinity College.

              Her first break in the music world was at the age of sixteen when
              her parents (with mixed feelings) entered her for a singing
              contest in Sydney. It was organized by TVB with the winner to be
              offered a recording contract with one of the big music companies
              in Hong Kong. She won the competition and was sent back to Hong
              Kong and met with the TVB producers who wanted her to sign with
              one of the music labels. After much deliberation she finally
              decided that it wasn’t right for her at that time and instead
              returned to Australia to study at University. She pretty much just
              settled back into life at Uni and put aside any dreams of a music
              career.

            After graduating from University she returned to Hong Kong in 1997
            to help run her family’s accounting business and gained CPA
            certification. Despite her relatively settled career Susan was
            thinking, “is that all there is in life”. One of the students who
            she was teaching piano was working for a Hong Kong independent
            label, and she asked the boss if they wanted a singer. Susan says “I
            really wanted to record the English songs that I loved. We agreed to
            make an album and I just went into the studio feeling really relaxed
            with no stress or pressure and had a fun time recording my ‘Close To
            You’ album.” When the album came out it in 2002 it was widely
            acclaimed and quickly became a favourite of music stores to play and
            the album was soon climbing up the sales charts in countries like
            Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. The four album
            release’s since, ‘Close To You’ have also enjoyed wide critical and
            commercial success establishing Susan as probably the No.1 selling
            English language female singer of her genre throughout S.E.Asia.
